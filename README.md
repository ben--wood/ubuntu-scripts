> *Warning* 

I'm not a Unix sysadmin or have much of a clue but I've had an Ubunut 14.04.4 Digital Ocean/Server Pilot VM running for 5 years with websites from various relatives (brothers, cousins, wives) on it and thought I'd like to get something similar running on my dev machine before updating to 20.04.
