I'm not a Unix sysadmin or have much of a clue but I've had an Ubuntu 14.04.4 Digital Ocean/Server Pilot VM running for years with (mostly WordPress) websites for various relatives (brothers, cousins, wives) on it and thought I'd like to get something similar running on my dev machine before updating to Ubuntu 20.04.
